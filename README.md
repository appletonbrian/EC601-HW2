#Tic-Tac-Toe Android Application
##Author: Brian Appleton (appleton@bu.edu)

This application was developed in order to become more familiar with Android application development and the Java language. Prior to this assignment, I had no experience with mobile app development or Java. This simple tic-tac-toe application explores capturing and responding to user interaction with UI elements. The computer AI is slightly smarter than a random player; it will attempt to stop the user from obviously imminent wins.

*This application was tested and debugged using Nexus 5 API 24 Android Emulator*
